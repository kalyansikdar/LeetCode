For finding shortest path to destination in Graph, we should NOT use DFS, we can have exponential unique paths in graph.
    DFS will run in exponential time.
    BFS will run in polynomial time. Hence, use BFS for finding shortest path in Graphs.

But in trees, we can have unique paths between nodes.
